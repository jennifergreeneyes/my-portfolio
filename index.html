                Hi! My name is Jenny and I am a professional PA and aspiring software engineer. In early 2020, I decided to switch careers and I enrolled on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.manchestercodes.com/software-engineer-fasttrack">Manchester Codes Software Engineer FastTrack bootcamp</a>, an intensive 6 month course designed to give you the skills to join the tech sector as a junior software engineer by the end. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I am originally from the Calder Valley, which people now know of because of Gentleman Jack and Happy Valley, but this little bit of Yorkshire is also where Quality Street and After Eights are made, where Catâ€™s Eyes were invented and was the site of one of the smallest (probably) battles of the English Civil War. We also boast one of the oldest night clubs in England, but we don't talk about that! I am happiest outside and with my family, or with my nose in a book. I studied Linguistics with Literature at York, which seemed to be the only way to cover two of my passions (Tolkien and language change) and not have to do a dissertation. My house is a bibliophiles haven, with books on every surface and I recently took a trip to Hay-on-Wye, a town in Wales known for its bookshops. I am also a keen musician and singer, having dedicated some of lockdown to also learning to play the harp.
